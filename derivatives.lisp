; If you want to differentiate arbitrary powers (not just integer exponents),
; then you need logarithms. But then if you have logarithms you can
; differentiate those, so then you need the multiplicative inverse, but then
; to differentiate those you need the additive inverse. At that point it's
; convenient to define the behavior of 1 and 0. So you end up having a bunch
; of math. Finally, you can define the general power function in terms of
; the natural exponential and logarithm.
